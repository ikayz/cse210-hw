# Encapsulation in Programming

**Encapsulation** is a core concept in object-oriented programming. It means bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is usually done by making variables private and providing public methods to access or modify them.

**Benefit of Encapsulation:**
One major benefit of encapsulation is that it protects the internal state of an object from unintended or harmful changes. By controlling access through methods (getters and setters), you can ensure that the data remains valid and consistent. This makes your code more reliable and easier to maintain.

**Application of Encapsulation:**
In my Scripture Memorizer program, I used encapsulation in the `Word` class. The text of the word and whether it is hidden are private variables, and I provide public methods to interact with them. This way, other parts of the program cannot change the state of a word directlyâ€”they must use the provided methods.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public class Word
{
    private string _text;
    private bool _hidden;

    public Word(string text)
    {
        _text = text;
        _hidden = false;
    }

    public bool IsHidden()
    {
        return _hidden;
    }

    public void Hide()
    {
        _hidden = true;
    }

    public void Unhide()
    {
        _hidden = false;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
In this code, the `_text` and `_hidden` variables are private, so they cannot be accessed or changed directly from outside the class. Instead, I use public methods like `Hide()`, `Unhide()`, and `IsHidden()` to interact with the word. This encapsulation keeps the internal state safe and makes the class easier to use and maintain. It also allows me to change how the class works internally in the future without affecting other parts of the program that use it.
